A couple months ago I went to a coding meetup in northern Colorado with professionals from all over the area. There experts from all sorts of different professions, and I had a ton a great conversations. There was one moment that stood out to me during the meetup though. I was discussing what technologies I used, React, Typescript, Postgres, and finally Java with Spring boot. As soon as I mentioned Java, the person I was talking to scoffed and said "Im sorry". Now, this isnt the first time I've heard this negative sentimate towards Java and Spring Boot eco system.

## JPA is kinda crazy
