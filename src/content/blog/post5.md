One of my best friends from college works on boats off the coast of Alaska, delivering fuel and supplies to coastal towns. He works 40 days on and 40 days off. At his job, he has met all sorts of interesting characters—the job attracts people from all over the world.

Several years ago, some of his coworkers told him about Utila, Honduras, a small island about an hour's ferry ride from the coast. On a whim, I decided to visit my old friend in this new and exciting place. Looking back, that trip changed my life in so many ways.

## The Journey to the Island

Getting to my destination was an adventure in itself. I flew out of Denver International Airport to Houston. After making my connection, it was another three-hour flight to San Pedro Sula Airport, the capital of Honduras.

Immediately after landing, I knew this place was different from anywhere I had ever been. The contrast between Denver and Honduras was drastic in so many ways—the climate, culture, people, and economic situation. This was far from a typical tourist destination; it felt so much more real.

After picking up my bags, my friend had arranged for a trusted driver, Johnny, to take me to the coastal town of La Ceiba, where I would catch a ferry to Utila. The ride was a highlight of the trip in many ways. It was amazing to see the countryside, roadside vendors, mountains, jungle, and the actual people of Honduras. I saw many people who didn’t have what I have, and it was eye-opening. It made me appreciate how lucky I am but also gave me an incredible opportunity to see the world from a perspective not many others experience.

The drive took about four hours, and I had exactly four hours to make it to my ferry. It was a white-knuckle ride the entire way. I was exhausted from traveling and really wanted to make the ferry—and so did Johnny. Let’s just say traffic laws in Honduras seem to be a little different than in Denver, haha.

Johnny was such a great person. He was learning English, and we spent the entire drive talking in a mix of English and Spanish. It was a lot of fun engaging in this way, and we helped each other learn our native languages.

Throughout the ride, I kept checking my navigation and wasn’t sure if I would make it. The estimated arrival time kept fluctuating, sometimes showing I’d arrive a few minutes before departure, sometimes a few minutes after. After dodging gigantic potholes, rolling through several police roadblocks, and passing slower vehicles, I made the ferry by about 30 seconds. What luck!

Johnny, if you’re reading this, I appreciate you so much—your kindness, curiosity, and determination to get me to my destination on time meant the world to me. Our paths will cross again soon.

## Finally Arriving

After a bumpy ferry ride, I arrived in Utila and stepped off the boat. My friend was waiting for me with a huge smile on his face. It was so good to see him after several years. We had lived together for about six years in college and had been friends even before that. Instantly, we picked up right where we left off.

If you've ever met someone you just click with, well, that's him for me. I grabbed my bags, and he rented a tuk-tuk to take me to his apartment. I was instantly impressed by his fluent Spanish—he had obviously been practicing during his time on the island.

As I rode in the tuk-tuk, following my friend on his motorbike, I knew immediately this place was different. There were no cars on the island—only motorcycles and bikes. The roads were narrow and densely packed. It was incredible to be somewhere so unlike any place I had ever been before.

## Renting My Own Bike

The next thing I needed to do was rent my own motorcycle for transportation. After all, I certainly wasn’t going to ride on the back of my friend’s bike the entire time!

At first, I was a little apprehensive. What if I fell and got hurt? Was I ready for this? But after a few days, this became one of the most exciting parts of the trip. You haven’t lived until you’ve ridden a motorbike in a third-world country haha. Speeding down narrow roads, following my buddy to different parts of the island—it was such an adventure.

It was such a great way to see what the island had to offer, a pure adrenaline rush (for someone who hasnt really ever ridden before). By the end of the trip, I had built up confidence, and the rented bike truly felt like it was mine.

## Touring the Island

During several days of my trip, my friend gave me tours of the island. Utila is about six miles in diameter—not huge, but still full of places to see and experiences to have.

One of the highlights was visiting the island’s small airport. My friend took me there, and we raced our bikes up and down the runway. Definitely not something you could do at an airport in the States!

At the end of the runway, there was a secluded beach known as Airport Beach. There was no one else there but us, and the beauty was unforgettable. We stayed for a while, just enjoying the scenery.

We also stopped at countless watering holes along the way. One of my favorite spots was a bar right on the coast. Sitting on the porch, drinking ice-cold Imperials, and chatting with locals, tourists, and people from all over the world—it was pure bliss.

At one point, a group of people arrived on horseback and tied up their horses right in front of the bar before joining us for drinks. Everyone was so welcoming and friendly. I felt an incredible connection to the people I met on this trip.

We also visited some of the more popular beaches on the island. I visited during Honduras’s rainy season, so many places were relatively empty. But I welcomed the cooler weather and the more relaxed atmosphere. Coming from Colorado, the climate was a perfect change. Each beach was beautiful in its own way and a joy to explore.

## Water Cay

Probably my favorite part of the trip was visiting Water Cay, a smaller island near Utila. Only a couple of people lived there to maintain the island, but it had no power, no facilities—just untouched nature.

My friend was good friends with a dive shop owner (shoutout to Josh—you’re the man). He hooked us up with a private charter boat to the island. We left in the morning and spent the whole day soaking in the surroundings, drinking ice-cold beers, and enjoying the company of some truly amazing people.

We stayed until the sun was setting and then rode the boat back across glassy waters, with the Honduran mountains in the background. The perfect weather, the stunning view, and the incredible people—I will never forget that moment.

## Wrapping Up.

There were so many unforgettable moments from this trip—catching up with my friend, exploring beautiful places, riding a motorbike through narrow island roads, drinking way too many cold beers.

But what made this trip truly special was the people. My friend had built an incredible community on the island, and they welcomed me as one of their own. Their kindness, hospitality, and genuine friendship made this trip one I will never forget.

I appreciate all of them so much. You truly made my trip unforgettable, and I look forward to seeing you all again soon.
