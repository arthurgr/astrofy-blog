Growing up in the heart of Chicago, the West and its natural landscapes were still very new to me. Exploring Colorado and its surrounding states has always been an adventure, but when I first began traveling, I never would have thought that New Mexico would become one of my favorite places on Earth. Even though it’s just south of Colorado, the deserts of New Mexico offer a stark contrast to what I'm now used to. You can see for miles all around you, with unique desert shrubs and plants, various mountains and plateaus peeking over the skyline, and rich cultural influences from both Mexican and Native American communities.

One place that stood out to me in particular was Ojo Caliente Hot Springs, about 40 minutes west of Taos. To say that this place is magical is an understatement, and I'd like to share my experiences so that maybe someday you can make the journey yourself.

## The Rio Grande del Norte

One of my favorite parts about this trip is the drive from Colorado. Usually a six-hour drive wouldn’t be something I look forward to, but this is different. It always blows my mind to see the changing countryside. The grassy plains of Colorado turn into desert scenery with unusual shrubs and plant life. You can see forever, with snow-capped peaks painting the Sangre de Cristo mountain range in the background. Eventually, out of nowhere, you cross the Rio Grande Valley, an area that reminds me of the Grand Canyon as it splits the desert in two.

The canyon itself is spectacular, and the bridge across it is an amazing feat of engineering. The wildlife is also something to behold; I’ve seen mountain goats, wild horses, coyotes, and rattlesnakes in the area. The desert is surprisingly full of life for such a harsh environment. After crossing the Rio Grande, it’s about 40 more minutes of driving through some of the most beautiful terrain I’ve ever seen, filled with mesas and mountains as far as the eye can see.

## Ojo Caliente Resort

After the six-hour drive, you finally arrive at the resort. It sits in a small valley, and several unique houses and yurts greet you as you pull in. You can immediately feel that this place is different. At the front of the resort, there is a desert garden with plenty of places to sit and enjoy the scenery.

When you first walk into the resort, you’re greeted by the main bathhouse. This place feels different from most of Colorado. It's not crowded, and you can see people lounging in hot springs, lawn chairs, and hammocks strewn about. Everyone has a relaxed vibe, and you’re instantly able to unplug from the hectic world and truly live in the moment while you’re there.

## The Hot Springs

Obviously, the main point of the trip is the hot springs. But these are different from any other hot springs I’ve experienced. There are various pools scattered throughout the resort, each unique in its own way. They are all said to have their own healing properties due to the mineral-rich water, from ulcer and digestion support to treating depression and different ailments. Each pool has its own level of heat, and it’s easy to find one that suits your preference. One of my favorite things about the pools is that many of them have large faucets continuously pouring hot water from the fixtures. It’s one of my favorite things in the world to sit underneath them and feel the water pour over you and your head. It creates a magical, almost massaging sensation that’s hard to explain. It’s really something special.

The main thing that really separates these hot springs from every other one I’ve been to is how the resort ties in all of your senses. For one, hearing. There is a no-talking policy at the resort, and they play mellow Native American flute music in the background that transports you to a place that feels before modern times, simple and peaceful. Then, smell. They have beautiful large pots of aromatic incense burning that smell absolutely wonderful. Not to mention the fresh eucalyptus inside the changing areas and bathhouse, which seems to clear you out and create such a relaxing environment. All of this including soaking, makes you forget about the troubles of life and always amounts to one of the most special weekends of the year.

This is just a brief glimpse of the visit, but I highly recommend that you check this out at least once in your life, because there is so much more to experience than what I wrote. This is truly one of my favorite places on Earth, and I think you would feel the same if you gave it a try.
