Growing up in the heart of Chicago, the West and its natural landscapes were pretty new to me. Exploring Colorado and its surrounding states has always been an adventure, but when I started exploring, I never would have thought that New Mexico would become one of my favorite and most beautiful places on Earth. Even though it’s just south of Colorado, the deserts of New Mexico offer such a unique and magical landscape. You can see for miles all around you, with unique desert shrubs and plants, various mountains and plateaus peeking over the skyline, and rich influences from Native Americans and Mexican Americans. The adobe huts and landscapes make it a truly special place.

One place that stood out to me in particular was Ojo Caliente Hot Springs, about 40 minutes west of Taos. To say that this place is magical is an understatement, and I'd like to share my experiences so that maybe someday you can make the journey yourself.

## The Rio Grande del Norte

One of my favorite parts about this trip is the drive from Colorado. Usually a six-hour drive wouldn’t be something I look forward to, but this is different. It always blows my mind to see the changing landscapes. The grassy plains of Colorado turn into a desert landscape with unusual shrubs and vast horizons. You can see forever, with mountains painting the Sangre de Cristo mountain range in the background. Eventually, out of nowhere, you cross the Rio Grande Valley, a river that reminds me of the Grand Canyon as it splits the desert in two.

The canyon is spectacular, and the bridge across it is an amazing feat of engineering. The wildlife is also something to behold. I’ve seen a combination of mountain goats, wild horses, coyotes, and rattlesnakes around the area. The desert is surprisingly full of life for such a harsh environment. After crossing the Rio Grande, it’s about 40 more minutes of driving through some of the most beautiful terrain I’ve ever seen, filled with mesas and mountains as far as the eye can see.

## Ojo Caliente Resort

After the six-hour drive, you finally arrive at the resort. It is surrounded by a mountain valley, and there are several unique houses and yurts that greet you. You can immediately feel that this place is different. In the front of the resort, there is a desert garden with plenty of places to sit and enjoy the scenery.

When you first walk into the resort, you’re greeted by the main bathhouse. This place is different from the majority of Colorado. It's not crowded, and you can see people lounging around in hot springs, lawn chairs, and hammocks strewn about. Everyone has a relaxed vibe, and you’re instantly able to unplug from the hectic world and truly live in the moment while you’re there.

## The Hot Springs

Obviously, the main point of the trip is the hot springs. But these are different from any other hot springs I’ve ever experienced. There are various pools scattered throughout the resort, each unique in its own way. They are all said to have their own healing properties due to the minerals in the water, from ulcer and digestion support to treating depression and different ailments. Each pool has its own different level of heat, and it’s easy to find one that suits your preference. One of my favorite things about the pools is that many of them have large faucets continuously pouring water hot water. It’s one of my favorite things in the world to sit underneath them and have the water pour over you and your head. It creates a magical, almost massaging feeling that’s hard to explain. It’s really something special.

The main thing that really separates these hot springs from every other one I’ve been to is how the resort ties in all of your senses. For one, hearing. There is a no-talking policy at the resort, and they play mellow Native American flute music in the background that transports you to a place that feels before modern times, simple and peaceful. Then, smell. They have beautiful large pots of aromatic incense burning that smell absolutely wonderful. Not to mention the fresh eucalyptus inside the changing areas and bathhouse, which seems to clear you out and create such a relaxing environment. All of this, including soaking in the healing waters of the hot springs, makes you forget about the troubles of life and always amounts to one of the most relaxing weekends of the year.

This is just a brief glimpse of the weekend, but I highly recommend that you check this out at least once in your life, because there is so much more to experience than what I wrote. This is one of my favorite places on Earth, and I think you would feel the same if you gave it a try.
