# Mobile App Design and Wireframing

We're excited to kick off our new **Mobile App** project! This will be a native iOS and Android application focused on productivity and task management.

## User Research

Before diving into design, we conducted extensive user research:

- **User interviews**: Spoke with 20 potential users about their pain points
- **Competitive analysis**: Studied existing apps in the space
- **Market research**: Analyzed trends and user behavior data

## Key Insights

Our research revealed several important findings:

- Users want **simplicity** over feature bloat
- **Offline functionality** is crucial for productivity apps
- **Cross-platform sync** is a must-have feature
- Users prefer **minimalist design** with clear visual hierarchy

## Wireframing Process

We started with low-fidelity wireframes for the core screens:

1. **Onboarding flow**: Welcome screens and initial setup
2. **Main dashboard**: Task overview and quick actions
3. **Task creation**: Simple, intuitive task input
4. **Settings**: User preferences and account management

## Design Principles

We established core design principles:

- **Clarity first**: Every screen should have a clear purpose
- **Speed matters**: Common actions should be accessible in 1-2 taps
- **Consistency**: Unified design language across all screens
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance from the start

## Next Steps

With wireframes complete, we're moving into high-fidelity mockups and prototyping. Stay tuned for the next update!
